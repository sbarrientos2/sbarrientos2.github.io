		<h1>When did my interest in technology start?</h1>
		<p>
			Everything started when I was a little kid. I was always very good at learning new things about computers. If anyone in my family 
			had a computer's problem, they would ask me and I would know the answer for most of the things and I would Google the ones that I 
			didn't know. I would spend big part of my day playing games in my dad's computer. I played all types of games, like shooters like 
			Counter Strike, to League of Legends and also a lot of World of Warcraft. 
		</p>

			When I got older I got very tired of computer games and that's when I got xbox live gold for the first time so I could play xbox 
			online with other people. And here my love for Call of Duty began. I put a lot of hours into these games, I just wanted to be 
			the best online and with my friends and it was that way. I ended up creating my own competitive team and actually playing some 
			tournaments in Colombia. Also I decided to start my Youtube channel about Call of Duty, to upload sort of like montages of my 
			best plays during the tournaments. I learned a lot about editing videos and creating 3D images. Mainly using Sony Vegas and 
			Cinema 4D. And here finding out that a computer could create so many cool effects and cool images got me into computers
			themselves. I wanted to know how a computer worked and learn how powerfull a computer can be.
