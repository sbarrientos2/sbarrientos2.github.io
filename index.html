		<h1>When did my love for technology start?</h1>
		<p>
                        Everything started when I was a little kid. I was always very good at learning new things about computers. If anyone in my family had a computer's problem, they would ask me and I would know the answer for most of the things and I would Google the ones that I didn't know. I would spend big part of my day playing games in my dad's computer. I played all types of games, like shooters like Counter Strike, to League of Legends and also a lot of World of Warcraft.

                        When I got older I got very tired of computer games and that's when I got xbox live gold for the first time so I could play xbox online with other people. And here my love for Call of Duty began.
