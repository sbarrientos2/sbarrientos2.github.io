		<h1>What is Gaming on Air?</h1>
		<p>
			Everything started back in college when I was just a freshman, and I decided to take website design for my second semeste. It wasn't a required course for me, I just really enjoy editing and computers so I thought it would be an interesting idea to be able to develop my own website. I have always been a technology love, I enjoy videogames a lot and computers. Then it came to my mind... "Gaming on Air" which I thought that could be a brilliant idea if I do it right. There are millions of people around the world that love gaming and are really into it, and every day is becoming bigger and bigger. So I told to my self: Why not to create a website that has everything together to make my visitors happy? That is when I decided to put all together and make an amazing website with information about professional players and teams, brand news about gaming and information about the biggest tournaments, including streamings and videos of it... Let's put everything I have learned in practice.
