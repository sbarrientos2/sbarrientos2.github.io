        <h2>Interactive Programming</h2>
		<p>
			Interactive programming has been very fun and interesting for me this semester. After getting the basics for programming
			last semester, I felt like I knew everything in this class but I was always learning new things anyways. But it did get harder
			we learned a lot of things this semester with this class. What I really liked about it was that the projects would be interesting things.
			Like creating a random quiz every time you wanted or to develop a basic videogame using Python, so I would really get into it,
			just to try to do my best. I ended up developing a game for my final about a spaceship that has to survive from the meteors.
			After taking this course I know how functions work, how Classes work, different libraries and modules, and other things.

        <h2>Effective Programming</h2>
		<p>
			This was a very cool class for me, I found everything problably the most interesting so far in my computer classes. 
			I really liked learning about bash. In this class I would use bash almost for everything in class, for finding files,
			copying files, deleting files, pushing stuff to Bitbucket, and it would be so efficient and easy. Our first thist was an exercise 
			that we needed to use bash for everything trough ssh to do what Dr. O'gwynn asked us to do. It would be for example about a folder 
			with one thousand files and folders, we would have to find files with certaing specifications, like what their contents were or the names.
			Then according to that, organize them in separate folders. All this only using bash commands and piping(|) a lot. 
			I know that after taking this course I now know how to use bash very well or if I don't know something I will Google it and find it,
			Googling is life.

        <h2>Operating Systems</h2>
		<p>
		This class was complicated at the beginning and has a lot of terms about computer that we need to know no matter what we want to do with our degree.
		Different from the classes I had taken, this one was the first one that taught me how to write C code. It was very difficult at the beginning because
		how different it is from Python. They are two very different languages C is not object oriented. I learned a lot of different things about how 
		computers work. I learned how to write basic C code, including For and While Loops, Functions. And about Bits and Bytes, memory management, processes,
		and other things.
