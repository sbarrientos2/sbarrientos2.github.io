			Optic gaming is the most famous competitive team in the United States, it is a team that started about six years ago. They started being a clan that uploaded videos daily to YouTube and that way they became very popular. YouTube was the first company that paid them for uploading videos because they had over one million subscribers. That way they got a YT partner and many companies sponsored them, giving them controllers and free videogames at firs. As gaming grew, they kept looking at ways to earn the most money they could get out of gaming and they finally figured out that competitive gaming is the best payed part of gaming. They have played around 50 tournaments and thet have earned about $500 thousand dollars in money prizes just for the torunaments. Kepping in mind that they also have at least four sponsors every year.
