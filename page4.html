	<h2>Cinema 4D</h2>

			<li><h3>What I've used it for?</li></h3>
		</ul>
		<p>
			This was one of the first programs I learned to use, in one stage of my life I was really into video editing and wanting to start a 
			youtube channel. Cinema 4D helped me a lot, it is a very interesting app to use, you can make any 3D image you want and also animations
			I used it mostly to create intros for my videos but then I just used it for fun, I would go and just create random image to learn more 
			about the program. I've created a lot of images with it, including the background of my computer and just random images.

			<li><h3>Photoshop</li></h3>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Photoshop is an amazing program. It is used all over the world, I found an interest in this specially for editing the images that 
			I would create in Cinema 4D. For example I would create a 3D image using 4D then I would take that image on photoshop and I would
			edit different aspects of the image, mainly the colors or the brightness and contrast of it to make it look a lot better. 
			Or to write my name on an image I have created. I started using Photoshop in my highschool in Colombia. But I kept using it 
			for a few years while I was working on my Youtube channel just to bring the best content.
