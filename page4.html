			<li><h3>When I started?</li></h3>
		</ul>
		<p>
			This was one of the first programs I learned to use, in one stage of my life I was really into video editing and wanting to start a 
			youtube channel. Cinema 4D helped me a lot, it is a very interesting app to use, you can make any 3D image you want and also animations
			I used it mostly to create intros for my videos but then I just used it for fun, I would go and just create random image to learn more 
			about the program. I've created a lot of images with it, including the background of my computer and just random images.
