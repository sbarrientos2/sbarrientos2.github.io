	<h2>Programs I have used</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><h3>Cinema 4D</li></h3>
		</ul>
		<p>
			This was one of the first programs I learned to use, in one stage of my life I was really into video editing and wanting to start a 
			youtube channel. Cinema 4D helped me a lot, it is a very interesting app to use, you can make any 3D image you want and also animations
			I used it mostly to create intros for my videos but then I just used it for fun, I would go and just create random image to learn more 
			about the program. I've created a lot of images with it, including the background of my computer and just random images.

		<ul>
			<li><h3>Photoshop</li></h3>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Photoshop is an amazing program. It is used all over the world, I found an interest in this specially for editing the images that 
			I would create in Cinema 4D. For example I would create a 3D image using 4D then I would take that image on photoshop and I would
			edit different aspects of the image, mainly the colors or the brightness and contrast of it to make it look a lot better. 
			Or to write my name on an image I have created. I started using Photoshop in my highschool in Colombia. But I kept using it 
			for a few years while I was working on my Youtube channel just to bring the best content. Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-NiDUrjZb3BGVeANbEXVCA">here</a> to go to my youtube channel.

		<ul>
			<li><h3>Sony Vegas</li></h3>
		</ul>
		<p>
			I would say that this is the programm out of all 3 that I used the most. I spend hours and hours in Sony vegas editing videos 
			from Call of Duty. I had a friend who would record some clips for me and then I would get all these and only get the best parts
			then I would make sort of like a montage a really cool edit of the best shots I had gotten that month for example. I would put an 
			intro from cinema 4D, and I would edit the video very well, I still have some videos on Youtube if you would like to check some. 
			I know how to edit everything from real live videos and also gaming videos. I know how to make the colors look good, add music to it
			put it slow motion and many other things. This is a great program and is easy and fun to use.
