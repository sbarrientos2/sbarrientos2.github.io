		<h2>Programming Fundamentals</h2>
		<p>
                        This was the first programming class that I had ever taken in my life. I had only written code a few times in the past just for fun and also for a couple classes that I had in my last school. It was a class like the name says, for teaching the fundamentals of programming using Python.

		<h2>Network Management</h2>
		<p>
                        This class was very different than the programming fundamentals one. In here we would work a lot more from the terminal in Mac. I think that in this class it was a lot more about learning terms and it required more reading. We talked in the class about a lot of different things, it turned out to be very interesting to know a little bit more about networks, we talked about network layers, IPv4 and IPv6, TCP/IP, about how to view network connections and many other things.
