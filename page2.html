		<h2>Programming Fundamentals</h2>
		<p>
                        This was the first programming class that I had ever taken in my life. I had only written code a few times in the past just for fun and also for a couple classes that I had in my last school. It was a class like the name says, for teaching the fundamentals of programming using Python.

			It has a large, active competitive scene. In North America and Europe, Riot Games organizes the League of Legends Championship Series, which consists of 10 professional teams in each continent. Similar regional competitions exist in China, South Korea, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia. These regional competitions culminate with the annual League of Legends World Championship, which in 2013 had a grand prize of $1 million and attracted 32 million viewers online. The 2014 tournament had the fifth largest prize pool in esports history, sitting at 2.3 million dollars.
